"""Tool-scope filtering for the HiAgent Knowledge MCP server.

A deployment may only want a subset of the tools exposed (e.g. restrict a host
to the Wiki tools so the agent reliably searches the Wiki). This module resolves
which tool names stay enabled from an optional allowlist and denylist; the server
registers every tool and then removes the ones this resolver excludes.

Both filters take exact tool names (comma-separated on the CLI / environment):
- allowlist selects the base set (``None`` / empty means "all tools");
- denylist is then subtracted from that base set.

Unknown names are rejected so a typo fails fast instead of silently doing
nothing.
